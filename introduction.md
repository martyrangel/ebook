# Brief introduction to the book

Howdy, internaut!
If you're reading this book, I assume you're a nostalgic fellow who also wants to build a website reminiscent of the 90s. However, you may have tried to build one, and have discovered that creating such beautiful pieces of art is challenging. Don't worry! That's why I'm here to help you. :D

We will dive into the trends of the 1990s to 2000s cyberspace, as they are essential to understanding how we can authentically replicate that retro vibe.
There were many trends back on 90s websites, such as having your visitors sign a guestbook, visitor counters, and blinkies/buttons(More on that later), and believe it or not, <span style="color: green; font-family: 'Comic Sans', cursive; font-size: 1.5em;">Comic Sans</span> was all the rage worldwide.
Yep O-O, Comic Sans. What the fu-

Many of these trends started due to the poor functionality of search engines. They were bad. Really bad. So people linked their websites by entering Webrings and by sharing Buttons with their friends. Buttons are like souvenirs from websites. Linking to another person's website meant that you liked their site, or that you were friends with the button's corresponding webmaster. 
We'll go over how to create a button yourself in a later page. 

In this book, I will teach you how to build your own website from scratch, what the trends were in the 1990s-2000s and how we can replicate the looks of such websites.
Without further ado, let's get started!
