# Chapter 1: The Basics

## What is a website?
Nowadays, we all know what a website is. You probably browse them daily, on Google Chrome or any other browser. Imagine them as small chunks of land with houses placed atop them. The land is their domain name and the house is its content. Every house contains a variety of rooms, also known as web pages, and the continents the houses are built on are web servers. 
What makes websites unique is their versatility. A website can range from trying to offer the viewer products to showcasing art.
To quote Wikipedia;

> A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.

You can see there is a *connection* between the *web server* and the *client*. A web server is a machine *serving* (or, sending) files to the *client*. The *client* is the web browser the user uses to browse the web via a terminal, such as a PC or a phone.  

A web browser is a piece of software that enables you to navigate through websites. It retrieves the HTML code from any Web Server and displays the website on the client following a set of standards that all browsers share.

Now that we know what a website is, let's dive further on how they work.
